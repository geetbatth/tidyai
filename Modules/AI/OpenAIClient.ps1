Organize these $totalCount items ($fileCount files and $folderCount folders) into logical, intelligent folders based on content patterns and purpose.

ORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES:
- Each item appears in EXACTLY ONE folder (zero duplicates allowed)
- Preserve ALL original filenames exactly as provided
- Create 3-8 meaningful folders with descriptive names
- Group by purpose, project, or content type
- Avoid generic names like "Other" or "Miscellaneous"
- Consider file extensions, names, dates, and folder contents for context

CRITICAL: ORGANIZE BOTH FILES AND FOLDERS!
- You MUST organize folders just like files - they are items to be moved, not just context
- Folders should appear in your response as items to be organized
- Group related folders together (e.g., "Project1", "Project2" folders into a "Projects" parent folder)
- Move folders based on their names, contents, and purpose
- A folder is an item that can be moved into another folder - treat it exactly like a file
- Balance folder sizes (avoid 1-item folders unless specialized)
- Use clear, professional folder names
- Prioritize logical grouping over alphabetical sorting
- Folders can be moved into other folders or merged based on content similarity

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: SAMPLE FILES ARE CONTEXT ONLY! ðŸš¨
- When you see "sampleFiles" in folder data, these are files INSIDE the folder for context
- DO NOT organize sample files as separate items - they are already inside their parent folder
- Only organize the folder itself, not the files listed in "sampleFiles"
- Sample files help you understand folder content but should NEVER appear in your response
- FORBIDDEN: Never include any filename from "sampleFiles" arrays in your organization response
- ONLY organize items with "type": "file" or "type": "folder" at the root level

- Files with similar purposes (installation files, documentation, media)
- Sequential files or series (parts 1, 2, 3 or chapters)

FOLDER NAMING:
- Use specific, descriptive names that reflect the actual content
- Include context like dates, projects, or purposes when relevant
- Avoid generic names like "Documents" or "Files"
- Examples: "Invoice Records 2024", "Project Phoenix Documentation", "System Installation Files"
